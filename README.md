# characterPrediction
Given a character list for a word, predict next character deterministically by building a tree

### Files in the repo:
- **src** : contains jupyter notebook using which we can deterministically uild a trie and make predictions. Currently, doing all evaluation only for last character prediction. The functions should be able to handle for all cases if data is suitably converted to train and test and given to the functions.
- **data** : some sample text datasets to play with.

For any further info/questions feel free to get in touch with me or create issues on this repo.
